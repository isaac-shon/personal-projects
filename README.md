# Isaac's Personal Projects

Hello! This GitHub repository showcases a brief collection of my personal coding projects focused on causal inference and econometric methods. 
Some of the projects in this repository include class assignments from _ECON 485: Causal Inference_, taken during Fall 2023 at Emory University.
Other projects include personal replication work and data simulation exercise of other econometric methods (e.g., Bartik Instruments).

This repository is designed to serve as both a portfolio of work and a resource for others interested in coding in STATA, Python, and R. 
Projects are organized by folder, complete with write-ups and code.
