# Isaac's Personal Projects

Hello! This GitHub repository showcases a brief collection of my personal coding projects focused on causal inference and econometric methods. 
The repository is designed to serve as both a portfolio of work and a resource for others interested in coding in STATA, Python, and R. 
Projects are organized by folder, complete with write-ups and code.
